The program prints a rhombus pattern using nested loops.  
- The outer loop controls the number of rows.  
- The first inner loop prints spaces before the stars to create the slanted effect.  
- The second inner loop prints a fixed number of stars in each row.  
- As the row number increases, spaces increase while stars remain the same, forming a rhombus.
